#Learning ESlint
##Let's Learn an ESLint Rule
semi-colon rule of ESLint, which is a popular JavaScript linting tool. The rule requires you to use semi-colons at the end of each statement in your code. If you have this rule set to "error", it means that ESLint will throw an error if a semi-colon is not present at the end of a statement. This is because the semi-colon is used to delimit statements in JavaScript and is considered good programming practice to use them consistently.
